Easton School is the center of the community because everything happens around it or in it. The school host all of the events that happen here. Like the pancake breakfast. On the Memorial Day parade we open up the school doors and set up a pancake breakfast. During the school year we go on trips around the community and the school sets up things like bingo night, movie night, and spaghetti feeds for everyone to come and enjoy it.
